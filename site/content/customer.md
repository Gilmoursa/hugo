## Part 1: Create a webpage
This is a webpage on a subdomain of my personal blog [AustinGilmour.com](http://www.austingilmour.com). I used [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static website engine to create the site.  The pages on this site are written in markdown using Sublime Text. I used [Netlify](http://www.netlify.com) to continuously deploy from a GitHub repository. Optimizing images, minifying assets, and minimizing request sizes, I was able to achieve a sub 1.5 second load time and a 96% on [PageSpeed](https://gtmetrix.com/reports/portfolio.austingilmour.com/N1A30tv2).

## Part 2: Tell Us About Yourself

### Where are you located?
I am located in the [Bedford-Stuyvesant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford%E2%80%93Stuyvesant,_Brooklyn) neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. However, in the past, I lived in South Korea, Wisconsin, and Florida.

### Why are you looking for a new position?
The responsibilities I enjoyed most in previous jobs were interacting with customers through training sessions, troubleshooting issues, and explaining complex technical ideas in simple verbiage. I am looking for a job that will allow me to pursue more of those responsibilities and also ideally allow me to work 100% remotely.

### Can you summarize your remote work experience?
In my [most recent role](/about#experience), I worked at minimum 2 days remote, and often entire weeks remote. I set up a home office with a large desk and dual monitors allowing me to work in a productive and distraction-free environment, while maximizing my efficiency. In my role prior to that, as a [Learn Expert](/about#experience), I was providing technical support and answering students' questions in a 100% remote environment. Early in my career at Epic Grooveshark, I had the option to work in the office or remotely. I often worked remotely in those two positions.  

### What should we definitely look at in your resume/work experience?
The work that I am most proud of is from my most recent role as a technical project manager. I managed a team of remote developers [creating websites](/) for some of New York's largest nonprofits including the New York Women's Foundation, Brooklyn Workforce Innovations, and City Bar Justice Center. These sites required months of planning and development. Each site presented it's own challenges and required implementing at least one completely new feature that involved a great deal of ingenuity and research into new plugins or APIs.

### What’s not on your resume/work experience but you think we should know?
I try to include as much as I can on my resume and it's always a challenge to narrow it down to one page. The two pieces I wish I had more room to include would be [Charity Connection](https://charity-connection.herokuapp.com/) and [Walk2Dinner](https://walk2dinner.herokuapp.com/), both are Ruby on Rails apps that I built when I was learning about programming. I think they both provide important context and showcase skills that otherwise may not appear on my resume. 

Charity Connection was a project I built with a few other students while we attended the Flatiron School. It was written using the Ruby on Rails framework with some Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The project's goal was to connect businesses with charities. Businesses that needed tax write-offs or were throwing away various office supplies, such as computers, could connect with charities that might be in desparate need of those supplies.

Walk2Dinner was the first project I made on my own, post-Flatiron School. I was new to New York and I wanted a tool to find new restaurants and get to know my neighborhood better. The app I built allows users to enter their address, then the app will randomly select a restaurant with more than 4 stars that is within walking distance of the user's address. The user is then presented with walking directions via Google Maps, the weather forecast (including chance of rain and time of sunset), and information about the restaurant (via Yelp).

### Can you summarize your HTML/CSS/JavaScript knowledge?
I started learning HTML in middle school and I've been using it ever since. I created pure HTML sites. I used HTML inconjunction with CSS frameworks, such as Foundation and Bootstrap. I used HTML and CSS together to create custom themes for WordPress sites. 

Javascript was a more recent learning experience. At the Flatiron School I learned [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/). Currently, I am teaching myself [React](https://code.facebook.com/projects/176988925806765/react/). In my last role, I mainly used [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) for animating elements on WordPress pages. 

### Why do you think you’re a good fit for this role?
Throughout my career, I've worn many hats. I've been a community developer, a project manager, a teacher, and a developer. However, the responsibilities of each role that I enjoyed the most were interacting with customers, clients, and students via either chat windows, emails, or ticket systems. 

I like taking complex ideas and distilling them into simple explanations. I'm comfortable writing code, but enjoy interacting with and helping people even more. I think this role plays to a lot of my strengths as well as interests.

### Anything else we should know about you?
I really like learning. I'm often picking up new hobbies as a way to continue learning about different disciplines. My most recent hobbies that I learned are: brewing beer and gardening. My girlfriend and I won second place in a homebrewing competition a few months ago. My garden started as a rocky dirt pit neglected for years by previous tenants and now it has 17 different vegetables growing in it as well as lush grass and several succulents. 

## Part 3: A Day in The Life

### Pre-Sales

**Imagine a potential customer emails you with the following question. We don’t yet offer this feature, but their current solution does. How would you respond?**

> I’m considering switching to Product Customizer. Does your app allow live image previews?

I would explain that we do not currently offer that feature, but that I would be happy to suggest a workaround that would allow for a similar outcome while utilizing a different feature such as making a test product to preview the desired change (this would depend on more information from the customer). 

### Fire Alarm
**Imagine you’ve just started your workday. You login and see a large number of emails from distraught customers. Clearly, something is happening. What steps do you take?**

Before answering any distraught customer emails, I would want to contact the development team as well as other customer support staff so I could gather more information regarding the issue and so the support staff could agree on one unified explanation for the issue customers are facing. In situations like this, I find consistancy and organization are key.

### Step-by-Step
**We’d like to get an idea of how you explain concepts and processes. What was the last thing your purchased online? Tell us, step-by-step, how you went about searching, choosing, and completing your purchase.**

The last thing I purchased online was a pair of Toms. My old pair of Toms finally broke. There was a hole at the end of the shoe where you could see my toe, so I decided it was time to buy a new pair. I really liked the previous pair I bought, but the dark blue color of my old pair showed dust easily, so I decided this time I would purchase a lighter colored pair of Toms. 

I opened my internet browser and typed `amazon.com` into the address bar. Once the Amazon webpage loaded, I typed `toms` into the search bar a the top of the Amazon webpage. 158 pages of results loaded. I toggled filters on the left hand side for the following characteristics:

 - Men: Shoes
 - Prime Elgible
 - 4 stars and up

This narrowed the results to 3 pages. I clicked the first thumbnail, in the top left corner. Clicking the thumbnail took me to the individual product page where I selected `Frost Grey Chambray` and size `11 D(M) US`. The total came to *$48.24*. I clicked the yellow "Add to Cart" button in the top right side of the page, just below the light grey "Amazon Fashion" menu. 

Clicking the "Add to Cart" button brought me to a confirmation page offering two options: "Cart" or "Proceed to checkout (1 item)". I was feeling confident in my shoe purchasing decision so I clicked "Proceed to checkout (1 item)".  This brought me to the Checkout page which displayed my shipping address and payment method already autopopulated from my last purchase. From this page, all I had to do was confirm my "Prime delivery option" and click the yellow button labeled, "Place your order". 

After clicking the button to place my order, I saw a final confirmation page offering me the opportunity to share my purchase details via social media. I declined the offer and closed out of the page. To confirm that my order went through correctly, I checked my email account for the Amazon order confirmation that I know from experience to expect.
